<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h3>H1 | Muli,800 | 36px</h3>
<br>

<h2>Secondary Heading</h2>
<h3>H2 | Muli,400 | 14px</h3>
<br>

<p>I chose Muli extra-bold 800 for my H1 font. This would be used for the banner/branding at the top of the page and would include the site's name, Aggregate Media Reviews. H2 consists of Muli regular 400 against the #222222 background color. This would be used for the aggregate review scores so that they stand out against the rest of the page. Muli is a sans-serif font which makes it better suited for these headings. I also feel like the numbers in Muli match well with the numbers in Taviraj, the font I chose for the paragraph text. This text is also in the regular 400 font-weight, although there is one exception. In cases where I would need to italicize the name of a book or film, like <span class="italic">Slaughterhouse-Five</span> by Kurt Vonnegut, I've set up my CSS to switch to Taviraj 400i. Taviraj is a serif font. Both were found on Google Fonts.</p>
<h3>P | Taviraj,400,400i | 14px</h3>
